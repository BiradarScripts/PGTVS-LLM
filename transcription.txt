[00:00:05] Welcome to the video. In this session, we will cover the basics of machine learning.
[00:00:12] Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data.
[00:00:25] There are several types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
[00:00:40] Supervised learning involves labeled data, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs.
[00:00:50] In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled, and the system tries to find patterns or structures.
[00:01:05] Reinforcement learning is about learning by trial and error, where the system receives rewards for correct actions.
[00:01:20] Now, let's explore some real-world applications of machine learning.
[00:01:30] One popular application is in self-driving cars, where the car learns to navigate based on sensor inputs.
[00:01:45] Another application is in healthcare, where machine learning algorithms help diagnose diseases from medical data.
[00:02:00] Thank you for watching this video on machine learning.
